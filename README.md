Hand Gesture navigation with Voice Control System

Problem Statement : 
In the modern word, the demand for intuitive and natural user interfaces is increasing. Hand gesture control provides a natural way to interact with computers and other devices without the need for physical contact.
Target Audiences:
- People with physical disabilities.
- Healthcare sector.
- Business professionals and Presenters.
- Gamers.
- Smart Home Users.
- Eduction sector.

Objectives:
* Implement a computer vision model that can detect and track hand moments in real time.
* Map specific hand gestures to mouse pointer actions(Move,click, drag, scroll).
* Ensure the system is responsive, accurate and user friendly.

Applications:
- Touchless user interface for public kiosks.
- Presentation control system.
- Accessibility tools.
- Medical and surgical applications.
- Gaming

Software Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- NumPy
- OS-specific libraries for executing system commands

Hardware Requirements:
- A computer with a webcam
- Sufficient processing power to handle real-time video processing

Summary:
This project involves developing a hand gesture recognition system using OpenCV and MediaPipe, enabling intuitive, contactless interaction with computers. It leverages real-time hand detection and machine learning to recognize user-defined gestures, facilitating control over various applications and enhancing accessibility, hygiene, and user experience across multipleÂ domains.
